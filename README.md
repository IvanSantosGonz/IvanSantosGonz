### Hi there 👋
![google headquarter](https://github.com/IvanSantosGonz/IvanSantosGonz/raw/master/ivanGoogleBW.png)

I am Iván Santos. I work as software developer 👨🏽‍💻 on Lean Mind from a paradise 🌴 place situated in Tenerife, Spain.

I am interested in a lot of things in different fields of computer science but my main topis are Android development 📱, cryptography 📚, and machine learning💻.

Currently, I am improving 💡 my skils in other areas like backend and frontend development, always with an eye on clean code and good practices. 

Moreover, I am just finishing my PhD in computer science (applied cryptography)🎓.
